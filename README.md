## Introduction
PukeiDex is a Monster Hunter World- inspired minigame where you collect information about monsters as you hunt them. Users level up their weapons as they progress through the game and will be able to take on harder environments and discover more monsters.

## Features
- Register and login system.
- Add new base weapons and remove any weapon in your armory.
- Choose a weapon, and pick a region to hunt in, each with their own monsters and difficulty.
- Receive an upgraded weapon after succesfull hunts, and save the monster's data.
- Lose progress as your weapon gets downgraded after a failed hunt.
- View the monster's information you have succesfully hunted in your encyclopedia. 

## Improvements
I did not turn in anything for the final assignment in the first semester. I did complete Milestone 1 (Design process) back then, but I have made adjustments since. They are listed below. 
Everything else is new.



### Design changes:
- Removed achievements (empty page)
- Changed base font to Arial
- Changed background color to white and header background to grey (they switched colors)
- Encyclopedia: Changed pictures from squares to circles and moved the name below the pictures
- Armory: Removed attack & elemental values (no longer used)
- Armory: Added an option for new weapons, using the same style as normal weapons
- Hunt: Updated the carousel (weapons) to be in line with new Armory
- Hunt: Updated hunt result overlay to a white rectangle background with the result (SUCCES/FAIL) on top, monster picture below, now slightly bigger. Added a message based on result below the picture
